Project Overview:

The goal of the Hotel Reservations Cancellation Prediction project is to anticipate potential reservation cancellations by analyzing various features and variables associated with hotel bookings. In the context of the project, online hotel reservation channels have revolutionized booking methods and customer behavior. However, a significant number of reservations are canceled, leading to revenue loss for hotels. Cancellations occur for reasons such as changes in plans or scheduling conflicts, often facilitated by the option of free or low-cost cancellations. This project seeks to predict such cancellations based on available data.
Data Dictionary:
Here is a data dictionary summarizing the key columns in the dataset:
| **Column** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **ID** | Unique identifier for each patient |
| **Age** | Age of the patient |
| **Gender** | Gender of the patient |
| **Hormonal Changes** | Whether the patient has undergone hormonal changes |
| **Family History** | Whether the patient has a family history of osteoporosis |
| **Race/Ethnicity** | Race or ethnicity of the patient |
| **Body Weight** | Weight details of the patient |
| **Calcium** | Calcium levels in the patient's body |
| **Vitamin D** | Vitamin D levels in the patient's body |
| **Physical Activity** | Physical activity details of the patient |
| **Smoking** | Whether the patient smokes |
| **Alcohol Consumption** | Whether the patient consumes alcohol |
| **Medical Conditions** | Medical conditions of the patient |
| **Medication** | Medication details of the patient |
| **Prior Fracture** | Whether the patient has had a prior fracture |

Conclusion:
The exploratory data analysis of the Hotel Reservations Cancellation Prediction project revealed several key insights:
1.	Guest Composition: Reservations made for 2 adults with no children, possibly representing couples, had the highest cancellation count. Reservations with children involved had lower cancellation rates.
2.	Booking Timing: Most reservations were made for weeknights and had significantly higher cancellations compared to those made for weekend nights.
3.	Year and Month: The year 2018 had a higher cancellation rate compared to 2017, with the highest cancellations occurring in July and October.
4.	Services Impact: Services opted for during reservation did not significantly impact reservation cancellations.
5.	Lead Time: Lead time had a significant impact on reservation cancellations. Guests with shorter lead times were less likely to cancel, while longer lead times increased the likelihood of cancellations. This suggests that the hotel should consider accepting reservations with shorter lead times.
6.	Market Segment: Reservations made through online platforms had the highest number of cancellations, emphasizing the importance of the hotel's online reputation.
In terms of predictive modeling, Decision Tree Classifier demonstrated the highest accuracy (85%) among the models employed, making it a promising choice for predicting reservation cancellations.
This project provides valuable insights for hotel management to optimize their reservation policies and reduce cancellations, ultimately improving revenue and customer satisfaction.
